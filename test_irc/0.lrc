[00:16.53]Anywhere you are  I am near
[00:20.35]Anywhere you go  I'll be there
[00:24.16]Anytime you whisper my name
[00:28.45]You'll see
[00:31.58]How every single promise I'll keep
[00:35.74]'Cause what kind of guy would I be
[00:39.65]If I was to leave
[00:41.16]When you need me most 
[00:47.29]What are words
[00:48.76]If you really don't mean them
[00:51.04]When you say them 
[00:55.02]What are words
[00:56.47]If they're only for good times 
[00:58.83]Then they're done 
[01:02.79]When it's love
[01:04.29]Yeah  you say them out loud
[01:06.29]Those words  they never go away
[01:10.59]They live on  even when we're gone
[01:18.45]And I know an angel was sent
[01:22.21]Just for me and I know I'm meant
[01:25.97]To be where I am
[01:27.81]And I'm gonna be
[01:33.58]Standing right beside her tonight
[01:37.73]And I'm gonna be by your side
[01:41.50]I would never leave
[01:43.10]When she needs me most
[01:49.31]What are words
[01:50.66]If you really don't mean them
[01:52.93]When you say them 
[01:56.88]What are words
[01:58.39]If they're only for good times 
[02:00.72]Then they're done 
[02:04.70]When it's love
[02:06.08]Yeah  you say them out loud
[02:08.05]Those words 
[02:09.35]They never go away
[02:12.52]They live on 
[02:15.56]Even when we're gone
[02:20.45]Anywhere you are  I am near
[02:23.85]Anywhere you go  I'll be there
[02:27.53]And I'm gonna be here
[02:29.98]Forever more
[02:35.67]Every single promise I keep
[02:39.66]'Cause what kind of guy would I be
[02:43.50]If I was to leave
